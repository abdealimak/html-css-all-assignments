# Canvas Hero Layout - "Motion"

A creative technical experiment where a complete website hero section—including navigation, typography, buttons, and UI mockups—is rendered entirely using the HTML5 Canvas API.

## 🚀 Features

* **UI Elements:** Features a mock navigation bar, a multi-line bold headline, call-to-action buttons, and abstract UI components.
* **Vector Graphics:** Custom shapes, arcs, and paths used to create modern geometric illustrations within the canvas.

## 🛠️ Built With
