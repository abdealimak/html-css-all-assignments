# Book Nest — Online Bookstore

A sophisticated, responsive e-commerce landing page for a boutique bookstore. This project focuses on a warm, literary aesthetic with a "cozy reading corner" theme and a clean product showcase.

* **Immersive Hero Section:** A warm, greeting area featuring an animated 3D-style CSS book stack decoration and a radial gradient background.
* **Interactive Book Cards:** * Smooth lift-on-hover animations.
    * Integrated "Add to Cart" functionality and price displays.
    * Dynamic scaling for book cover images.
* **Responsive Layout:** A mobile-first design that transitions from a 4-column desktop grid to a single-column mobile view.
